    "Motivation\n",
    "----------\n",
    "Sparse matrices are matrices that are mostly empty i.e. zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "They appear frequently when solving physics problmes, such as in the PDE of a linear chain with 6 elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Differential Equation describing these these systems is called *Hooke's Law*:\n",
    "$-\\ddot{x}=\\mathbf{\\kappa} x$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case $\\kappa$ is a matrix containing the spring coefficients acting on each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\kappa =\n",

    "\n",
    "As one can see, most of the elements in this matrix are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these type of problems and in many more, these matrices can get very large and memory intensive. We therefore need a way of working with these low density matrices in a memory efficient way.\n",

    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will focus on the CSR format.\n",

    "\n",
    "- AVAL : the values\n",

    "As we can see in the header of each profiled function, the first method `_mdot` is ~40 times slower than `_mdot_fast` in computing a matrix product of two (100x100)-matrices.<br>\n",
    "The reason for the speed up is mainly due to the inefficient use of `__getitem__` and `__setitem__`.\n",
    "On thier own, these methods are sufficiently fast, but when used in a function which uses these n²-times they are very inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more efficient way is to directly work with the storage scheme; as done in the `_mdot_fast`.\n",
    "An attempt was made to improve `__getitem__` and `__setitem__`. However we were unable to achieve a significant improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach was done using caching or memoization. By using the `@memoize` decorator, it is checked wether the function has already been evaluated with the given arguments. If this is the case, the previous value is returned without calling the function. If the arguments do not match previous function calls, the function is evaluated and its output is stored in a dictionary with the arguments as the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this would in theory speed up the calculations, it significantly slowed them down. The reason is again the enormous number of calls to the decorator and the time gained by cached value is not sufficient to nullify the time penalty.\n",

    "Therefore it has to be considered if the time penalty constitutes the logical simplicity. In our opinion it clearly did not, hence to keep performance high the default behaviour is the `_mdot_fast` method.\n",

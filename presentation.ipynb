    "Motivation\n",
    "----------\n",
    "Sparse matrices are matrices that are mostly empty i.e. zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "They appear frequently when solving physics problmes, such as in the PDE of a linear chain with 6 elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Differential Equation describing these these systems is called *Hooke's Law*:\n",
    "$-\\ddot{x}=\\mathbf{\\kappa} x$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case $\\kappa$ is a matrix containing the spring coefficients acting on each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\kappa =\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n",
    "-1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & -1\\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 2\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As one can see, most of the elements in this matrix are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these type of problems and in many more, these matrices can get very large and memory intensive. We therefore need a way of working with these low density matrices in a memory efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to not store the redundant zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "Storage scheme\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "Not storing the zeros can be done with a number of different strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **C**ompressed **S**parse **R**ow     (CSR)\n",
    "- **C**ompressed **S**parse **C**olumn  (CSC)\n",

    "- **Coo**rdinate List                   (COO)\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will focus on the CSR format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSR format consists of 3 lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "|      | 0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 |\n",

    "| JCOL | 1 |  2 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  3 |  4 |\n",
    "| IROW | 0 |  2 |  5 |  8 | 10 |\n",
    "\n",
    "- AVAL : the values\n",
    "- JCOL : the index in the matrix where the value from AVAL belongs\n",
    "- IROW : these are the indices of AVAL or JCOL where a new row begins\n",
